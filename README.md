# CSE Rebuild – Python Foundations

This repository documents my attempt to rebuild core programming fundamentals from scratch.
I am a CSE undergraduate who previously passed labs without fully understanding the logic.
This repo is part of a structured 18-month recovery plan.

## Day 1 – Python Basics

### Topics Covered
- Variables and input/output
- Data types and type conversion
- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions and return values

### Practice Details
- Total exercises: 19
- Each exercise is written manually (no copy-paste)
- Focus was on logic, not optimization or shortcuts

### Common Mistakes I Faced
- Returning from inside loops too early
- Variable name conflicts
- Missing edge cases (equal values, zero input)
- Output formatting issues

### What I Learned
- Why control flow placement matters
- How accumulator patterns work
- How small logic errors break entire programs
- How to debug instead of guessing

### Folder Structure
day-1/python_basics/
│── basic.py
│── exc2.py
│── exc3.py
│── ...
│── exc19.py


### Rules I Followed
- No built-in shortcuts (e.g., max(), sum())
- No AI-generated code
- No skipping difficult exercises
- Every program tested manually

This repository will grow daily as I rebuild my fundamentals before moving to
DSA, DBMS, and Machine Learning.
